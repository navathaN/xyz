robokindDemo 
============
Example Java project using RoboKind Basic API. For use with R50 robot.

## This project has been moved to the [RoboKind repository] (http://www.github.com/subalary/RoboKind) .
Some major refactoring has taken place and the robokindDemo repository is no longer being updated.

### Classes (with main method; can be run)

* App.java => demonstrates the basics in main method
* VisitorDemo.java => beefs up the basics a little
* SensorTest.java => the RoboKind example of how to test the sensors
* JointTest.java => tests a given joint and then returns it to default
* GripDemo.java => class which demonstrates the robot's grip; also shows how to use SetSettings.java and Expression.java

### Classes (with no main method)

* SetSettings.java => simple class which sets all the addresses used in connecting to robot
* Expression.java => class to make robot use facial expressions and neck movements
